Challenge: 
Create batchable apex that will delete stale Account records. Stale account records are Accounts 
with no related open opportunities for the last 6 months. 

Create schedulable apex that will execute the batch class above. 
 
Schedule your schedulable apex to run at 12 am at the first of every month. Take a screenshot of your 
scheduled job from within the setup menu and include it in the repo
